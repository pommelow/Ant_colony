Intel(R) Advisor can now assist with vectorization and show optimization
  report messages with your source code.
See "https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-advisor-xe" for details.


Begin optimization report for: iso_3dfd(float *, float *, float *, float *, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int)

    Report from: Vector optimizations [vec]



Non-optimizable loops:


LOOP BEGIN at iso-3dfd_parallel.cc(162,3)
   remark #15543: loop was not vectorized: loop with function call not considered an optimization candidate.
LOOP END
